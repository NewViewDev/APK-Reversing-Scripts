# Android Reverse Engineering Script Toolkit

This is a repository for any scripts that may be useful for an Android Reverse Engineer. Please feel free to contribute.

## Software Requirements:
    Not all scripts will require all of the following tools. A script's folder path should be a good hint as to requirements.

    However, here are some common programs that these scripts run:
    - [Android SDK Platform Tools](https://developer.android.com/tools/releases/platform-tools)
    - [Apktool](https://apktool.org/)

## Style guide
    For more complicated scripts, please include some form of -h or --help command
